# GraphDB_Neo4j
One night with Neo4j

I had 1 night to decide whether spending a large amount of time on Graph databases will be fruitful.

I decided to delve a little into Graph databases with the following factors to consider:
1. Run a truncated business problem rather than some tutorial.
2. Can I get meaningful information in a short amount of time?
3. How scalabale this entire thing is on my moderately powerful machine?
4. How flexible it is in comparison to the pythonic approach? Data manipulation, feature generation etc
